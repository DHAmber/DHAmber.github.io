Interesting Graph and Machine Learning papers
</p>

### Large Scale Machine learning

1. "[GraphSAINT Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method](www.openreview.net/pdf?id=BJe8pkHFwS)"
<br>           Zeng et al. -<b> ICLR 2020</b>.
 <br><br>
  <b>Contribution:</b>
  <br>       a. Samples sub-graphs and runs GCN on entire sub-graph without node sampling in layers.
<br>         b. Defined node and edge sampling procedure in order to avoid bias.
  
<br>

### GNN

1. "[Position-aware Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04817.pdf)"
<br>           You et al. -<b> ICML 2019</b>.
 <br><br>
  <b>Contribution:</b>
  <br>       a. Two nodes, even if they have same neighboorhood get different embeddings. This is not in the case of GraphSage.
<br>         b. Uses Landmark nodes and weighs message from node to landmark nodes using distance to landmark node.
  
<br>

2. "[Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning with Differentiable Pooling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08804.pdf)"
<br>           Ying et al. -<b> NeurIPS 2019</b>.
 <br><br>
  <b>Contribution:</b>
  <br>       a. Aggregates nodes into clusters.
<br>         b. Coarsens clusters into larger level clusters.
