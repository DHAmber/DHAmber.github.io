# Short Bio

I am a final-year Ph.D. student in Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/)'s [Data Mining Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) at [CS@Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/), and a [Google PhD Fellow](https://ai.google/research/outreach/phd-fellowship). I received my B.E. from Computer Science Department, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ. (SJTU), China, where I was a member of the 2010 [ACM Honored class](http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/), now part of Zhiyuan College in SJTU. 

In the past, I was lucky to collaborate with [Hang Li](http://www.hangli-hl.com/index.html) in Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and [Tianqi Chen](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tqchen/) in University of Washington. I spent half a year working with [Yu Zheng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuzheng/) in Microsoft Research Asia. [Cong Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/congyu/home) is my Google Research internship host. I am honored to receive the Computer Science Excellence Scholarship and Grand Prize of Yelp Dataset Challenge in 2015. 

In addition, I love competitive programming contests, such as ACM/ICPC, Topcoder Open, Google Codejam, Facebook Hackercup, etc. I'm now the coach of the UIUC's ACM/ICPC team.


# My Research

My research focuses on transforming **unstructured text** data into **structured heterogeneous information networks**, on which actionable knowledge can be further uncovered flexibly and effectively based on userâ€™s instructions. My proposed **data-driven** approach, with **little human curation and labeling**, consists of four essential steps.

1. Language- and domain-agnostic quality phrase mining;
2. Distant supervised named entity recognition;
3. Data-driven, open-domain relation and attribute discovery;
4. Construction and consolidation of heterogeneous information networks.
