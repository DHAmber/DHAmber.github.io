# <center>Short Bio</center>

I am a second-year Ph.D. student working under the supervision of Dr. [Sayan Ranu](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~sayan/) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [IIT Delhi](https://cse.iitd.ac.in).

My research is focused on learning algorithms for large scale graphs and dynamic networks. Currently Iam working on problems associated to Combinatorial optimization for sparse and large graphs and Deep learning methods for querying large scale traffic networks. My [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OPyjQHwAAAAJ&hl=en) can be visited for more details. 

Prior to joining IIT Delhi, I worked as a Research Engineer in the Machine learning and statistics group at Conduent Labs( Formerly Xerox Research Center India). I received my Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](http://iitg.ernet.in/cse).
