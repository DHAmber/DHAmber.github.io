**Research Interests**: Constructing and mining knowledge from massive unstructured text corpora with minimal human effort. The minimal human effort refers to only using public, general knowledge bases and shallow linguistic analyzers (e.g., tokenizer).

I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student in Prof. [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/)'s Data Mining Group at [CS@Illinois](https://cs.illinois.edu/), and a Google PhD Fellow. I received my B.E. from Computer Science Department, Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ. (SJTU), China, where I was a member of the 2010 [ACM Honored class](http://acm.sjtu.edu.cn/), now part of Zhiyuan College in SJTU. 

In the past, I was lucky to collaborate with [Hang Li](http://www.hangli-hl.com/index.html) in Huawei Noah's Ark Lab and [Tianqi Chen](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~tqchen/) in University of Washington. I spent half a year working with [Yu Zheng](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/yuzheng/) in Microsoft Research Asia. [Cong Yu](https://sites.google.com/site/congyu/home) is my Google Research internship host. I am honored to receive the Computer Science Excellence Scholarship and Grand Prize of Yelp Dataset Challenge in 2015. 

In addition, I love competitive programming contests, such as ACM/ICPC, Topcoder Open, Google Codejam, Facebook Hackercup, etc. I'm now the coach of the UIUC's ACM/ICPC team.
